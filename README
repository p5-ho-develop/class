h2. HO::class

This is a simple class builder. It is used to create array based
classes during compile time. It sets up the constructor new.
Inheritence is supportet, but dynamic addition of new properties is not.
It is possible, but may not work well with inheritence. Until now there
are no benchmarks.

One feature I like most is that methods can be overwritten for a
object. The system is extensible (and breakable) via some global
variables.

One source of ispiration for this package was Class::Struct.
